## Getting Started

The SageBot is a Telegram chatbot built using Node.js.

Sage is powered by Cohere AI to engage users in conversation, offering stories with up to 1000 words upon request. Additionally, it utilizes the Wikipedia API to provide random pages and make small searches, presenting users with lists of potential topics.

Users can save tales, random pages, and search lists, stored in a MongoDB database. The bot also can delete the stored content.

For deployment, Sage runs on Google Cloud Run using Docker containers, ensuring easy deployment and updates. However, it can also be run locally if preferred.

The Sage Project combines Node, Telegraf, Cohere, Wikipedia, and MongoDB to provide knowledge and entertainment to users.

### Configuration

Create a .env file and add the parameters like: 

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Deploy

#### Local

After creating the .env file and configuring it correctly, follow these steps:

- Install the necessary files using npm: ```npm install```

- Start your local server: ```npm run start```

That's it! You'll now be running the project locally.

#### Google Cloud Run 
To deploy using Google Cloud Run, might seem more complex, but with Docker and a Dockerfile in place, the process becomes straightforward:

1 - If not already installed on your computer, install Docker and Docker Compose.

2 - Create the Dockerfile running ```docker build -t PROJECTNAME .```

3 - Configure your project with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

4 - If not installed on your computer, install the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

5 - Initialize gcloud in your project [folder](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing).

6 - Begin the deployment process with the command: ```gcloud run deploy```.
